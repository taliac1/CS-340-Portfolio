How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

-For my code I kept the correct formatting as well as an easy to read code by making the names still understandable. For project ones CRUD method I was able to connect the database with a python code making it more readable for everyone to adjust the data if needed. Working with CRUD helped me understand how to connect python with databases. My current job is working as a data analyst I do later want to become a support specialist at my work. And that job requires combining sql and python. So understanding crud is insanely helpful in my future career.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

-I made a list of what needs to be done and followed that list when writing my code. I also followed the workflow chart given withen the course.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

one of the many things Computer scientists do is help develop and fix programs which is insanely helpful to have a company run. Without computer scientists programs wouldnt be created/updates or even fixed.
